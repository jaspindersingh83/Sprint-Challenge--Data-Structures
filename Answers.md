1. What are the order of insertions/removals for the following data structures?
   - **Stack** ----LIFO
   - **Queue**-----FIFO
2. What is the retreival time complexity for the following data structures?
   - **Linked List**---O(n)
   - **Hash Table**---O(1)
   - **Binary Search Trees**---O(log(n)
2. What are some advantages to using a Hash Tables over an array in JavaScript?
Stores key:value pairs. So search is O(1).
Can be used with Limited Array. So efficienct memory allocation. Rebalances as size of iput data increases.
